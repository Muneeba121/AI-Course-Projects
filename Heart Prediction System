Heart Prediction System
Developed an AI  application for predicting heart disease risk using Python and Scikit-learn, leveraging the Random Forest algorithm for high accuracy. Integrated LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to provide explainable AI, empowering non-technical users to interpret predictions through intuitive visualizations. The interactive Gradio interface not only displays the risk assessment but also offers personalized health recommendations and doctor-style advice, fostering informed decision-making about heart health. Additionally, the system includes a user-friendly dashboard that tracks individual health metrics over time, allowing users to monitor their progress. Regular updates incorporate the latest medical guidelines, ensuring the advice remains relevant and effective. The application aims to bridge the gap between complex machine learning models and everyday health management, promoting proactive wellness strategies.
